# Particle Effects Experiment with Three.js and GLSL Shaders

This project is an experiment that combines Three.js and GLSL shaders to create particle effects when hovering over an image.

## Credits

This project is a variation (and was forked) from [@brunoimbrizi's](https://github.com/brunoimbrizi) [Interactive Particles](https://github.com/brunoimbrizi/interactive-particles) repository, and is a part of his Domestika course [Creative Coding 2.0 in JS: Animation, Sound, & Color](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3862-creative-coding-2-0-in-js-animation-sound-color)

## Features

- Interactive particle effects when hovering over an image
- Customizable particle behavior and appearance through GLSL shaders
